Build a responsive Masonry gallery page that satisfies these constraints:

Layout

Max 4 columns horizontally on large screens.

Use CSS Columns–based masonry (preferred) or an equivalent grid that mimics masonry behavior.

Vertical flow should comfortably handle ~45 images (no pagination needed).

Gaps between items: uniform, ≤ 20px (use 16px as default).

No rounded corners anywhere.

Image mix & sizes (approximate)

About 75% Landscape images: 1500×1000 px (3:2).

About 10% Portrait images: 1000×1500 px (2:3).

About 15% Square images: 1000×1000 px (1:1).

Provide a small fixture dataset of ~45 items matching those ratios. Use placeholders or local assets; the exact pixels can be scaled, but keep aspect ratios.

Hover overlay

On hover (and focus for keyboard accessibility), show a full-image overlay: semi-transparent gray layer covering the tile.

Overlay must display the image’s ALT text in white text, centered (both axes).

Smooth fade-in/out transition (~150–250ms).

Ensure overlay is pointer-events: none except for links if present.

Accessibility & performance

Every image must have an alt attribute (use the same string for the overlay).

Add loading="lazy" to images.

Respect reduced-motion (@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)).

Responsiveness

Columns by breakpoint (example):

≥1200px: 4 columns

900–1199px: 3 columns

600–899px: 2 columns

<600px: 1 column

Keep the same uniform gap at all sizes.

Styling rules

Use break-inside: avoid; on items to prevent column breaks.

No borders or shadows by default.

Neutral, minimal styling; easy to theme later.

Deliverables

A single index.html + styles.css (and optional tiny script.js only if needed).

A small JSON or inline JS array with ~45 items (title/alt, src, aspect type).

Clear instructions where to replace placeholder image URLs with real ones.

Acceptance check

Grid never exceeds 4 columns on desktop.

~45 tiles render with the requested aspect ratio distribution (≈75/10/15).

Hover overlay shows alt text in white, full-coverage gray, with smooth transition.

Uniform spacing ≤20px at all breakpoints.

No rounded corners.

Optional niceties (if quick):

Simple lightbox on click (no dependencies) is a plus, but not required.
