
 Technical Description for Replit – Homepage (Layout inspired by NewApology, using Dummy Images)
Goal:
Build a minimalist one-page layout inspired by NewApology.com (header, split hero section, horizontal image strip, and footer).
All images should be dummy placeholders generated locally — no external assets or copied media.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Vite + React (TypeScript)
Tailwind CSS for layout and spacing
Framer Motion (optional, for smooth fades)
Lenis (optional, for smooth scrolling)
lucide-react for menu icons (hamburger / close)
No router, no CMS, no analytics or trackers

 Page Structure (Single Homepage Only)
1. Header (sticky, white, slightly transparent)
Left: Text logo “pix.immo”
Center/Right: navigation links “Index”, “Information”, “Journal”
Additional buttons on the right: “Contact” and “Deutsch”
Mobile: collapses into a hamburger menu with a smooth fade/slide overlay
2. Hero Section (two-column layout)
Generous whitespace above (≈120 px)
Left column: large dummy image area with oversized headline (placeholder “pinto”)
Right column: large dummy image area with centered text (“PAVLO LOTNIK”)
Subtle hover effect (slight zoom or opacity change)
3. Horizontal Image Strip (ImageStrip)
Full-width horizontal section below the hero
8–12 dummy images arranged in a seamless horizontal line
Smooth, infinite auto-scroll animation (loop)
Auto-scroll pauses when hovered
4. Footer

￯ﾸﾏ Dummy Images (Path & Specifications)
Storage path: /public/images/
Generation: create neutral SVGs or solid-color PNG/AVIF files with overlaid text labels (e.g., “Dummy 2400×1600”)
Required files:
hero-left-2400x1600.avif (or .png) — green/neutral gradient, text “pinto”
hero-right-2400x1600.avif (or .png) — white background, text “PAVLO LOTNIK”
Image strip: strip-01…strip-12-1200x800.avif (or .png) — neutral colors or gradients, text “Dummy 1200×800”
Alt texts: “Dummy image n” (to be replaced later)
Performance: use loading="lazy", decoding="async", and always include width and height

 Design Guidelines
Lots of white space
Neutral typography (system sans-serif, slightly increased letter-spacing)
Colors: white (#fff), light gray (#f8f8f8), black (#111)
Animations: subtle, linear (no bouncing or snapping)
Hover states: small visual change (e.g., 1–2 % zoom or slight opacity fade)

✅ Acceptance Criteria
Runs locally in Replit with npm run dev
Header works correctly on desktop and mobile (hamburger menu opens/closes)
Hero section displays two dummy image tiles side by side on large screens (stacked on small screens)
Horizontal image strip scrolls infinitely and pauses on hover
Footer visible and correctly aligned
No console errors; layout stable (no CLS jumps)
No external assets — only local dummy images

 Notes
Dummy images can later be replaced 1:1 with real images using the same filenames and aspect ratios.
Suitable for static deployment via Cloudflare Pages or any static host.
